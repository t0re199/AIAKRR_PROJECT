# README #

This project has been developed for the Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning class by [t0re199](https://github.com/t0re199), [adel3roman6](https://github.com/adel3roman6) and [Rosaria97](https://github.com/Rosaria97).  
      
Here-in you can find a Java implementation of an automatic player for the Murus Gallicus game.    


## Algorithm ##

A parallelized implementeation of the **Mini-Max** algorithm with **Alpha-Beta Prunining** has been provided.   


## Heuristic ##

Provided heuristic is based on a **heatmap**.    


## Player Characteristics ##

The player implements an adaptive game strategy: research space tree's depth is determined at runtime by taking into account the elapsed time reqired to perform the previous moves.


## Requirements ##

JDK >= 1.8 required.
